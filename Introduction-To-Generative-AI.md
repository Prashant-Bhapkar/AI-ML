# Introduction to Generative AI

## Course Overview
- **Instructor:** Dr. Gwendolyn Stripling, AI Technical Curriculum Developer at Google Cloud.
- **Aim:** Understand Generative AI, its workings, model types, and applications.

## Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition:** AI is a branch of computer science creating intelligent systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously, aiming to mimic human-like thinking and behavior.
- **Subfield:** Machine Learning (ML) is a part of AI, teaching models to make predictions without explicit programming.

## Machine Learning Types
- **Supervised ML:** Learns from labeled data with tags (e.g., names, types).
- **Unsupervised ML:** Deals with unlabeled data, discovering natural groupings or patterns.

## Deep Learning in Machine Learning
- **Definition:** Deep learning uses artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain.
- **Characteristics:** More complex patterns learned through multiple layers, allowing for powerful modeling.

## Generative AI in the AI Discipline
- **Subset:** Generative AI is part of deep learning, involving artificial neural networks.
- **Capabilities:** Processes both labeled and unlabeled data, using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods.

## Generative Models vs. Discriminative Models
- **Discriminative Models:** Classify or predict labels for data points.
- **Generative Models:** Generate new data instances based on a learned probability distribution, creating new content.

## Generative AI in Practice
- **Output Types:** Natural language, speech, text, images, audio, and video.
- **Example:** Traditional models predict numbers; generative models create language, images, or audio.

## Generative AI Mathematical Representation
- **Equation:** y = f(x), where y is the output. If y is a number, it's not generative; if it's natural language, it is generative.

## Evolution from Traditional Programming
- **Traditional:** Hard-coded rules.
- **Neural Networks:** Recognition based on examples.
- **Generative Wave:** Users generate content using models trained on large datasets.

## Formal Definition of Generative AI
- **Definition:** Generative AI creates new content based on learned patterns from existing data.
- **Process:** Training on existing content results in a statistical model, predicting expected responses and generating new content.

## Generative AI Applications
- **Examples:** Sentiment analysis, code generation, text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video, and more.
- **Foundation Models:** Pre-trained large models adaptable to various tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, image captioning).

## Generative AI Studio and App Builder
- **Studio Features:** Pre-trained models, fine-tuning tools, deployment tools, community forum.
- **App Builder:** Codeless app creation with a drag-and-drop interface, visual editor, search engine, and conversational AI engine.

## PaLM API
- **Purpose:** Test and experiment with Google's large language models and gen AI tools.
- **Integration:** Can be integrated with the Maker suite for graphical user interface access.

## Conclusion
- **Thanks:** The course provides insights into generative AI and its various applications.
